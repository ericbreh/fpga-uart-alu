See this LatchUp 2023 slide deck for a detailed rational and description of bsg_tag:

bsg_tag is quite fast (400 mbps) for many configuration tasks, but for gate-level sims of large chips, it can be helpful to accelerate evermore. 
One approach is to directly manipulate the lines coming out of bsg_tag master. Partial orders between tag addresses can be encoded in a file, and
then a scheduler can derive the maximally parallel bsg_tag sequence that can boot the chip through a SystemVerilog testbench.
